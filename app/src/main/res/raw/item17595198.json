I was worried about the SMS code method&#x27;s security, but I had no other way to ensure that losing my phone wouldn&#x27;t leave me with no way to get into my accounts.  (If I lose my phone I can still resurrect my phone # on another device by SIM replacement).<p>The U2F works fine for corporate, etc. where you have a support team who can help you in case you lose it or forget anything.  They can make you come in person and prove that you are you.<p>The problem with implementing this for personal is that if you ever lose the key or code generator, you are absolutely fucked because there is no way to prove who you are to Google and have them reset your password &#x2F; security.","time":1532373920,"type":"comment"}
