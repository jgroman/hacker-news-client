If you&#x27;re already at the point that you&#x27;re keying your user&#x2F;pass into a phishing site, you&#x27;re not going to second guess punching in the 2FA code to that same site.   I&#x27;d even argue push validation like Google Prompt would be at a significant risk for phishing, unless you are paying close attention to what IP address for which you&#x27;re approving access.","time":1532360807,"type":"comment"}
