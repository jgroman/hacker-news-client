If a TOTP code is stolen, it&#x27;s probably not even useful because it&#x27;s already invalid when they log in (including for time based, in well-designed software.)<p>There&#x27;s obviously a class of attack that hardware tokens protect against (malware) that password managers can&#x27;t entirely (unless your operating system has good sandboxing, like Chrome OS for example.) But it really does protect against phishing to a degree, as well as certain attacks (key loggers or malicious code running on a login page on the browser)<p>Hardware tokens are the winning approach, but even when you put TOTP into a password manager it is far from useless.","time":1532392496,"type":"comment"}
