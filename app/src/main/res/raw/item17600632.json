This allows one to log in and reset their 2FA token. What happens if you lose your Yubikey or similar? I guess this doesn&#x27;t matter as much in an enterprise setting where there is a dedicated IT department but for for individual use outside of the enterprise doesn&#x27;t TOTP and a software device have a better story in case of loss of the 2FA device?","time":1532437643,"type":"comment"}
