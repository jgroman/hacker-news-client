If you use 1Password or Authy, your token is your 1Password&#x2F;Authy credential.<p>The hardware based token approach is always going to be better, because the secret is part of the device and isn&#x27;t portable. The Yubikey and challenge&#x2F;response tokens are great as you need to have it present, you cannot easily get away with hijinks like putting a webcam on your RSA token.","time":1532363703,"type":"comment"}
