We want these things to be cheap enough to give away.<p>State is only expensive when it adds a significant amount of die area or forces you to add additional ICs. If you need a ton of flash memory, you can&#x27;t put it on the same die because the process is different, and adding a second IC bumps up the cost. However, staying with the same process you used for your microcontroller, you can add some flash with much worse performance... which is a viable alternative if you only need a handful of bits. Your flash is slower and needs more die area, but it&#x27;s good enough.<p>&gt; The counter make tokens weakly trackable. If Facebook knows your token&#x27;s counter was 205 when you signed in at work this morning and 217 when you signed in from your iMac this evening, somebody who visited GitHub at midday with counter 213 might be you, someone with counter 487 definitely isn&#x27;t you, or at least not with the same token.<p>What kind of ridiculous threat model is this? &quot;Alice logs into Facebook and GitHub, and Bob, who has compromised both Facebook and GitHub&#x27;s authentication services...&quot; Even then, it&#x27;s not guaranteed, because the device might be using a different counter for Facebook and GitHub.","time":1532360319,"type":"comment"}
