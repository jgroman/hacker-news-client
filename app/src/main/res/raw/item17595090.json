What do you mean by &quot;for each website&quot;? Certainly that doesn&#x27;t mean every website in existence, so there must be some process by which a new website is registered with the hardware and the key communicated to the site?<p>But if so, I don&#x27;t see how that solves the problem of &quot;user goes to site X for the first time, mistakenly thinking it&#x27;s Github.&quot;  That registers a new entry for the site and sends different credentials&#x2F;signatures than it would send to Github.  But site X doesn&#x27;t care that they&#x27;re invalid, and logs you in anyway, hoping you will pass on some secret information.<p>Am I missing something?","time":1532373163,"type":"comment"}
