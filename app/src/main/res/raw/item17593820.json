The token could use a per-site offset (securely derived from the per-site key) added to the global counter, and&#x2F;or could have a set of global counters (using a secure hash of the per-site key to select one). I don&#x27;t know how much that would increase the cost, or if there&#x27;s something on the standard mandating a single global counter.","time":1532363522,"type":"comment"}
