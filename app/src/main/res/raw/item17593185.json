You correctly describe the upside - if Bob&#x27;s device says 4, then 26, then 49 it&#x27;s weird if the next number is 17, and we may suspect it&#x27;s a clone.<p>But there are many downsides, including:<p>Devices now need state, pushing up the base price. We want these things to be cheap enough to give away.<p>The counter make tokens weakly trackable. If Facebook knows your token&#x27;s counter was 205 when you signed in at work this morning and 217 when you signed in from your iMac this evening, somebody who visited GitHub at midday with counter 213 might be you, someone with counter 487 definitely isn&#x27;t you, or at least not with the same token.","time":1532357872,"type":"comment"}
