Google, Github, and Facebook supported U2F 2 years ago - so all I can see is Twitter, Dropbox and niche security news like KrebsOnSecurity.com have added support since then?  Sure it&#x27;s something, but 2 years I would have expected more - Who am I missing?  Without more websites, consumer mass market has little incentive to adopt - and without users, websites have little incentive to support U2F - thereby furthering the stalling.","time":1532369468,"type":"comment"}
