{"by":"394549","id":17594350,"parent":17592982,"text":"&gt; One thing I don&#x27;t understand is why are apps like authy or google authenticator not using push notifications to allow you to directly auth via unlocking or touchID instead of having to go through the app. If you really want the user to type something then you can still use push notitication for easy app access<p>My company has something like that, through Symantec.  When you need to authenticate, it sends a notification to your phone over the network for you to acknowledge.<p>It&#x27;s terrible though: cell signal is horrible in our building, so the people who use it are constantly dealing with delays and timeouts.  I opted for a hard token that has no extra network dependencies, and I&#x27;m happy with my decision.","time":1532367639,"type":"comment"}
